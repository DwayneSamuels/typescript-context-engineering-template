## Original Work

This TypeScript Context Engineering Template is adapted from the original work by **Cole Medin**.

### Original Repository
- **Repository:** [Context Engineering Intro](https://github.com/coleam00/context-engineering-intro)
- **Author:** Cole Medin ([@coleam00](https://github.com/coleam00))
- **License:** MIT
- **Original Language:** Python

### What Was Adapted

The core concepts and methodology from Cole's original Python-based Context Engineering system were adapted for TypeScript/Node.js development:

1. **Core Workflow:** The INITIAL.md → PRP generation → execution workflow
2. **File Structure:** Organization of templates, examples, and commands
3. **Claude Code Integration:** Custom slash commands for automation
4. **PRP Template System:** Product Requirements Prompt methodology
5. **Context Engineering Philosophy:** The fundamental approach to providing comprehensive context

### Modifications for TypeScript

The following adaptations were made for TypeScript/Node.js:

- **Language-Specific Rules:** Updated CLAUDE.md with TypeScript conventions
- **Tooling Changes:** Replaced Python tools (pytest, mypy, ruff) with TypeScript equivalents (jest, tsc, eslint)
- **Example Code:** Created TypeScript examples for Express, authentication, database patterns
- **Package Management:** Adapted for npm/yarn/pnpm ecosystem
- **Framework Patterns:** Added Express.js, Prisma, JWT authentication examples
- **Testing Patterns:** Updated for Jest testing framework
- **Type Safety:** Emphasized TypeScript strict mode and proper typing

## License

This TypeScript adaptation maintains the same MIT license as the original work.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to Cole Medin for:
- Pioneering the Context Engineering methodology
- Creating a comprehensive, production-ready workflow system
- Sharing the original work under an open-source license
- Demonstrating how proper context can transform AI-assisted development

The original work's emphasis on validation loops, comprehensive examples, and systematic approach to AI context has been invaluable in creating this TypeScript adaptation.
